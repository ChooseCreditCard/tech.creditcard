      <h2>What Is Card Payment Technology?</h2>
      <p>“Card payment technology” is everything that happens between the moment you tap, swipe or type in a card number and the moment the transaction is approved. It includes chips and terminals, mobile wallets, network rules and issuer decision systems.</p>
      <p>Most people only see the card and the terminal. Behind the scenes, multiple systems communicate to identify the cardholder, apply limits, score risk and decide whether the payment should go through.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How a Modern Card Transaction Flows</h2>
      <p>When you hold a card, phone or wearable near a reader, the NFC chip establishes a secure, short-range connection. The card or wallet sends a tokenized payment credential – instead of the raw card number – to the terminal.</p>
      <p>That credential is routed through the payment network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.), where the issuer checks:</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Whether the credential matches a valid card or device token</li>
        <li>Available credit or balance on the underlying account</li>
        <li>Risk score based on recent behaviour and device patterns</li>
        <li>Merchant category, country and any relevant limits or blocks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the checks pass, the issuer responds with an approval and a cryptographic authentication code. If not, the transaction is declined or a step-up authentication challenge may be required.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Virtual Cards, Wallets and Wearables</h2>
      <p>Many card products now offer virtual card numbers, mobile wallets and wearable payments. Technically, these are different representations of the same underlying account.</p>
      <p>Virtual cards often have their own number, expiry and controls, but ultimately settle to the same credit line. Wallets and wearables hold tokenized versions of the card in a secure element on the device, unlocked with biometrics or a PIN.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limits, Controls and Risk Engines</h2>
      <p>Behind every approval or decline there are configurable limits. These can include per-transaction caps, daily and monthly totals, region restrictions and merchant-category blocks.</p>
      <p>Issuers also run risk engines that look at device signals, spending patterns and previous fraud reports. If something looks unusual, the system may decline, require extra authentication or temporarily lock the card.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Security and Authentication Layers</h2>
      <p>Security is handled in layers rather than by a single control. Card numbers, tokens, cryptograms, device binding and user authentication all work together.</p>
      <p>Depending on the channel, you might see chip-and-PIN, tap-and-go with background risk checks, or extra authentication such as 3-D Secure challenges for online payments.</p>
